Description:

This project is a basic Tetris game created using JAVA. Tetris is a game in which blocks are spawned from top and the user can move the block down, left, right and can even change the angles of the block. By the time the preceding block reaches the bottom of the game area, new blocks are spawned. Blocks are of different shapes. If the user if able to make a single unit-heighted row i.e. if the user is able to make a complete line, he gets scores and based on the score, he/she either wins or loses.
